## About Me
![Bjoern's Photo](/image/headshot.jpg)

I'm a graduate student at George Washington University working toward my M.S. in Computer Science. My expected graduation date is May 2017.

I earned my Bachelor of Science degree in CS in 2016.

Since May 2015, I have been working as a research assistant and conducting researches with Professor [Evan Drumwright](https://edrumwri.github.io) in the [Positronics Lab](https://positronicslab.github.io) at GWU. Our main goal for the research is to find an accurate way to simulate the dynamics of a multi-rigid-body system.

## Some Academic Achievements

* Awarded ***Best Senior Design Project*** for "A Fast Algorithm for Finding the Minimal Translational Distance between Two Interpenetrated Polyhedra". *The algorithm was further developed and used in [Moby](https://github.com/PositronicsLab/Moby/), an open source rigid body dynamics simulator developed by The Positronics Lab.*
* Graduated ***magna cum laude*** (in CS at GWU, Spring 2016)
* **Dean's List** honors: Spring 2013, Fall 2013, Spring 2014, Fall 2015, Spring 2016
* **Dean's Commendation List** honors: Fall 2012, Fall 2014, Spring 2015
